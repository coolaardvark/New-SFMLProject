# New-SFMLProject
 Creates a stub Visual Studio solution folder (2022) for a SFML based C++ project.

 A fairly simple script that takes a known localtion for the SFML lib, bin and include folders 
 creates the required Visual Studio directory stucture and sets up the solution and project 
 files (.sln and .vcxproj respectivley) so the project should build with no futher 
 configuration tweaking.
